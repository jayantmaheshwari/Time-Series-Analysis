Crime presents a threat to public safety, and its influencing factors could be complex. 
This report aims at identifying the influencing factors and patterns of the occurrences of crimes in 
Los Angeles.  Understanding the impact of economic and other external factors such as weather conditions 
on crime is critical for ensuring the government's agility to deal with recurrent crises. Specifically, 
we measure the impact of GDP, homelessness, weather conditions, and unemployment rate on crime per capita 
in Los Angeles from Jan 2010 to Aug 2020. The research reveals that crime shows a weak positive correlation
 with GDP, rent CPI, temperature, and a slight weak negative correlation with the unemployment rate. 
Based on the overall robustness, simplicity, accuracy, and interpretability, an ADL model with seasonal
 components, crime rate lagged by 2, as well as GDP lagged by 12 and its quadratic terms and the cubic term
 is chosen to provide a short term crime rate forecast in LA. We have also looked at forecasted crime against 
actual crime that happened in 2020 (Covid-19 year) for a structural break, but it was observed that there was 
no significant impact of the pandemic year on crime for the chosen duration.
